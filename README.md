# Shadowsocks Enterprise
I wanted to build a shadowsocks service with username/password model authentication with its clients like [shadowsocks-auth](https://github
.com/Lupino/shadowsocks-auth) but as [clowwindy](https://github.com/clowwindy) [said](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks/issues/169) it's 
wrong implementation. So here is my new communication protocol;
This protocol is very similar to the shadowsocks protocol which is also very similar to SOCKS5 but encrypted, simpler and with 
secure username/password authentication.

## Build

## Run

## Todo
- UDP Support
- Traffic Statistics
- More clients applications
